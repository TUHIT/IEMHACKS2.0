        <h2>Earthquake Safety</h2>
        <p>An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the earth caused by the shifting of underground rock. Deaths and injuries occur when people fall trying to walk or run during shaking or when they are hit by falling debris. Smaller earthquakes, called aftershocks, always follow the mainshock. Earthquakes can cause tsunamis, landslides, fires, and damage to utilities. Earthquakes can happen anywhere, and there is no way to predict them. But we can take action to prepare. Prepare now to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your home.

        <h2>Tsunami</h2>
        <p>A tsunami is a series of ocean waves caused by earthquakes, landslides, or volcanic eruptions. These waves can kill and injure people and destroy entire communities. Tsunamis strike as fast moving walls of water that flood, drain, and re flood the land for hours. Tsunamis can flood more than a mile inland. But we can take action to prepare. Prepare now to protect yourself and your loved ones.

        <h2>Flood</h2>
        <p>Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods can result from rain, snow, coastal storms, storm surges, overflows of rivers, and dam failure. Floods can be dangerous. People die by drowning when they donâ€™t evacuate before floodwaters come or when they enter floodwaters. Floods can damage buildings and roads, cause power outages, and create landslides.

            Floodwaters carry waste and pollute drinking water. Flooding can develop slowly or quickly. Flash floods can be sudden and violent. Climate change increases our risk of many types of flooding. But we can take action to prepare. Prepare now to protect yourself and your loved ones.
